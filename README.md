Why Bootstrap CSS? Well, I went with Bootstrap CSS to style my app for the following reasons:

## Familiarity:

One of the reasons we went with Bootstrap is because I'm familiar with it and it has its benefits for a simple application.

## Responsive Design:

Bootstrap hooks us up with a responsive grid system and ready-made classes that make sure our app looks awesome and works smoothly on all kinds of devices and screen sizes.

## Time Saver:

Bootstrap brings a bunch of pre-designed components and styles to the party, which means I don't have to whip up as much custom CSS but for some of the designs requried I had to use custom CSS to acheive the design specs.

Issues Experienced:

- I had issues with installing the redux package for some reason.
- I had some issues with the articles API but found a way to fetch the array of stories via &{id}.

With more time, what changes would I make:

- I would have created a local server with server.js to handle my data such as the ImageCard.js data.
